PMC3263921	Results	BPSS1509	FALSE	Surprisingly, mutant ΔBPSS1509, but not ΔBPSS1539 revealed a significantly higher invasion in HepG2 cells compared to the wild-type strain (Figure 1C).
PMC3263921	Results	BPSS1539	FALSE	Surprisingly, mutant ΔBPSS1509, but not ΔBPSS1539 revealed a significantly higher invasion in HepG2 cells compared to the wild-type strain (Figure 1C).
PMC3263921	Results	BPSS1539	FALSE	In contrast, T3SS mutant ΔBPSS1539 was almost exclusively observed in association with LAMP-1, suggesting that the mutant is unable to escape from endocytotic vesicles 8 h after infection (Figure 2A).
PMC3263921	Results	BPSS1539	FALSE	However, 16 h after infection some of these huge vacuoles seemed to become leaky and B. pseudomallei ΔBPSS1539 could be detected within the cytosol in association with actin tails (Figure 2B).
PMC3263921	Results	BPSS1509	FALSE	As the wild-type the T6SS mutant ΔBPSS1509 was rarely seen associated with LAMP-1 8 h after infection, but actin tails could not be detected at this time point (data not shown).

PMC3263921	Results	BPSS1539	FALSE	To determine whether reduced intracellular growth of T3SS and T6SS mutants correlates with an increased viability of hepatocytes, we measured the electrical impedance after infection of HepG2 cells with B. pseudomallei wild-type as well as the T3SS (ΔBPSS1539) and T6SS (ΔBPSS1509) mutants at a MOI of ~400.

PMC3263921	Results	BPSS1509	FALSE	Figure 3C illustrates that the electrical impedance of HepG2 cells after infection with the T6SS mutant ΔBPSS1509 did not differ significantly from the one of uninfected cells whereas infection with the wild-type strain resulted in a strong loss of electrical impedance.
PMC3263921	Results	BPSS1539	FALSE	The decrease of the Normalized Cell Index observed in HepG2 cells infected with the T3SS mutant ΔBPSS1539 was significantly delayed compared to wild-type infected cells.
PMC3263921	Discussion	BPSS1539	FALSE	We report here that the intracellular growth of B. pseudomallei in hepatocytes is partially dependent on a functional T3SS, since mutant ΔBPSS1539 (BsaU) exhibited reduced intracellular replication (Figure 1C) as well as decreased cell damage (Figure 3C) in HepG2 cells.
PMC3263921	Discussion	BPSS1509	FALSE	We previously described that mutant ΔBPSS1509, encoded within the B. pseudomallei T6SS-1 cluster, displays no intracellular growth defect in J774A.1 macrophages and HeLa cells, but is required for virulence in mice (Pilatz et al., 2006).
PMC3263921	Discussion	BPSS1509	FALSE	In contrast, the present study indicates that mutant ΔBPSS1509 reveals delayed and reduced induction of actin polymerization (data not shown) as well as decreased intracellular replication (Figure 1C) and reduced cell damage (Figure 3C) in hepatocytes compared to the wild-type.
PMC3263921	Discussion	BPSS1539	FALSE	Thus, our results suggest that BPSS1539 encoded by T3SS-3 and BPSS1509 encoded by T6SS-1 are potential virulence determinants that enable intracellular growth of B. pseudomallei and induce cell damage in hepatocytes.

PMC3269093	Discussion	BPSS1183	FALSE	The first of these was a protein encoded by BPSS1183 with a putative function similar to a Pseudomonas syringae syringomycin biosynthesis enzyme for a phytotoxin or syringomycin product, a known virulence factor that causes the phosphorylation of several membrane polypeptides [37].

PMC3159172	Intracellular Invasion, Escape from Endocytic Vesicles, and Survival within the Cytoplasm	BPSL1528	FALSE	In addition to bsaU, Pilatz et al.

PMC3159172	Intracellular Invasion, Escape from Endocytic Vesicles, and Survival within the Cytoplasm	BPSL1528	FALSE	These findings contrast with those for a bpsl1528 mutant (encoding a putative exported protein) that not only displayed severely restricted intracellular growth in HeLa and J774A.1 macrophages, but was also defective in formation of actin-tails and membrane protrusions.
PMC3159172	Intracellular Invasion, Escape from Endocytic Vesicles, and Survival within the Cytoplasm	BPSL1528	FALSE	All mutants identified by Pilatz et al. (2006) that were defective for intracellular growth (purM, purN, hisF, pabB, and bpsl1528) were also attenuated for virulence in BALB/c mice following intranasal infection.
PMC3159172	Intracellular Invasion, Escape from Endocytic Vesicles, and Survival within the Cytoplasm	BPSL1528	FALSE	Interestingly, in the case of the purM, pabB, and bpsl1528 mutants, all animals not only survived following challenge with 10^7 CFU, but also showed no signs of disease (Pilatz et al., 2006).
PMC3159172	Intracellular Invasion, Escape from Endocytic Vesicles, and Survival within the Cytoplasm	BPSL1528	FALSE	This study therefore highlights the important role that the purine, histidine and para-aminobenzoate biosynthetic pathways and bpsl1528 play in pathogenesis.

PMC3159172	Actin-Based Motility: A Crucial Mechanism for Cell-to-Cell Spread	BPSL1528	FALSE	Another gene which has been implicated for its potential role in actin-tail formation is bpsl1528 which encodes a putative exported protein (Pilatz et al., 2006).
PMC3159172	Actin-Based Motility: A Crucial Mechanism for Cell-to-Cell Spread	BPSL1528	FALSE	As described above, a bpsl1528 mutant was defective for intracellular growth; immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that actin-tail formation was severely impaired as only rudimentary actin-tails were observed and no protrusions could be detected in HeLa cells.
PMC3159172	Actin-Based Motility: A Crucial Mechanism for Cell-to-Cell Spread	BPSL1528	FALSE	Pilatz et al. (2006) therefore speculated that the pleiotropic phenotype of the bpsl1528 mutant may be due to a regulatory function of the encoded protein on numerous virulence factors rather than to a single effector molecule.

PMC2518269	Abstract	BPSL0721	FALSE	Increased expression of a gene encoding for a putative membrane protein (BPSL0721) was confirmed using a lux-based transcriptional reporter system, and maximal expression was noted at approximately 6 hrs after shifting cells from LB to water.
PMC2518269	Abstract	BPSL0721	FALSE	A BPSL0721 deficient mutant of B. pseudomallei was able to survive in water for at least 90 days indicating that although involved, BPSL0721 was not essential for survival.

PMC2518269	Methods	BPSL1534	FALSE	Mutagenesis of the B. pseudomallei poly (3)-hydroxybutyrate synthase gene (phbC or BPSL1534) and BPSL0721 was achieved using the lux-based suicide vector pGSV3-lux as previously described (Moore, et al., 2004).
PMC2518269	Methods	BPSL0721	FALSE	Mutagenesis of the B. pseudomallei poly (3)-hydroxybutyrate synthase gene (phbC or BPSL1534) and BPSL0721 was achieved using the lux-based suicide vector pGSV3-lux as previously described (Moore, et al., 2004).
PMC2518269	Methods	BPSL0721	FALSE	For BPSL0721, a 424 bp internal region was amplified using the primers TGTGGATGTCGCAGATGC (Forward) and ATGAAGCGGGTCTTCGACG (Reverse).
PMC2518269	Methods	BPSL0721	FALSE	Integration of pGSV-lux-phbC into phbC and BPSL0721 was confirmed by PCR using a reverse primer internal to the luxC gene on the vector and a forward primer located at the 5' end of the phbC and BPSL0721 genes and upstream of the forward primers used to generate the internal fragments originally cloned into pGSV3-lux.
PMC2518269	Results	BPSL0721	FALSE	The suicide vector pGSV3-lux was used to insertionally inactivate one of these genes, BPSL0721, to determine if this gene was essential for survival in water.
PMC2518269	Results	BPSL0721	FALSE	The resulting mutant, RM0721, was examined further and was shown to produce lux-mediated light when shifted from LB to water indicating expression of the BPSL0721 gene under these conditions (Fig. 2).
