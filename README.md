# pubmed

`pubmed` is an `R` package to download XML documents from Pubmed Central (PMC).  There are over 2.7 million full text articles in PMC and 22% are available for text mining in the Open Access (OA) subset.  However, the number of OA publications is increasing rapidly each year and 67% of PMC articles published in 2012 are open access (view [code](/inst/doc/pmc_growth.R) ).
